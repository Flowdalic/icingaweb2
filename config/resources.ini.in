; resources.ini
;
; The configuration file *resources.ini* contains data sources that
; can be referenced in other configurations. This allows you to manage
; all connections to SQL databases in one single place, avoiding the need
; to edit several different configuration files, when the connection
; information of a resource change.
;
; Each section represents a resource, with the section name being the
; identifier used to reference this certain section. Depending on the
; resource type, each section contains different properties. The property
; *type* defines the resource type and thus how the properties are going to
; be interpreted. Currently only the resource type *db* is available.
