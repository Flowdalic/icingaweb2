# The dashboard

The icingaweb dashboard allows you to display different views on one page. You can create customized overviews over
the objects you're interested in and can add and remove elements.

## Dashboard, Panes and Components

![Dashboard structure][dashboards1]

* The building blocks of dashboards are components - those represent a single URL and display it's content (often in
  a more condensed layout)
* Different components can be added to a pane and will be shown there. All panes are shown as tabs on top of the dashboard,
  whereas the title is used for the text in the tab
* The dashboard itself is just the view containing the panes
